- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for utility-first styling to speed up development.
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind's responsive utilities and modifiers.
- Customize your theme with Tailwind's configuration for consistent branding.
- Ensure accessibility by using Tailwind's focus states and screen reader support.
- Respect the WCAG 2.1 AAA Standards.
- Use utility classes directly in JSX for faster development.
- Create custom components for reusable UI patterns.
- For conditional clsses use the `cn` function to merge the tailwindcss classes in the proper way.
- Favor logical utilities such as ms-3 over explicit ltr/rtl variants.
- Migrate to the new v4 naming for shadow/radius/blur (shadow-xs, shadow-sm, etc.).
- Use @container queries and @max-* variants (with the container-queries plugin) for parent-width-driven responsiveness.
- Build responsive layouts with Catalyst’s SidebarLayout + Navbar + Sidebar and apply flex-1 for flexible growth.
- Declare layers explicitly: @layer theme, base, components, utilities; import CSS into each layer.
- Leverage group, checked, data-[disabled], and starting variants for state-based styling and transitions.
- Add !important globally when integrating into legacy CSS: @import "tailwindcss" important;.
- Use grid col-start / col-end utilities and container queries for complex layouts.
Install via npm install tailwindcss@latest @tailwindcss/vite@latest for Vite projects.
- Combine Shadcn UI components with Tailwind utilities for accessible interactivity.
- Stick to the full color scales (e.g., bg-sky-50 … bg-sky-950) for consistent palettes.
