Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    82→    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n    83→  - Gotchas encountered:\n    84→    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    85→    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n    86→### ZenStack Database Commands\n    87→- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n    88→- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n    89→- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n    90→\n    91→---\n    92→\n    93→## 2026-01-20 -

It's automatically updated\nafter each iteration and included in agent prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### ZenStack Model Patterns\n- Use `@id @default(dbgenerated(\"uuidv7()\"))` for primary keys\n- Use `@default(auth().organizationId)` for organization-scoped models\n- Use `@default(auth().userId)` for audit fields\n- Use `@@map(\"table_name\")` for PostgreSQL table naming (snake_case)\n- Use `@@unique([field1, field2])` for composite unique constraints\n- Access policies: `@@allow('create', auth() != null)` for authenticated users\n- Use named relations like `@relation(\"relationName\")` when a User model has multiple relations to the same model (e.g., createdBy, updatedBy)\n- DateTime date-only fields use `@db.Date` annotation\n\n### Seed Script Patterns\n- Seed scripts live in `apps/server/` (e.g., `seed.ts`, `seed-gas.ts`)\n- Run with `pnpm --filter @acme/server db:seed` or `db:seed-gas`\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth-dependent defaults\n- Always fetch a real user from DB when seeding models with `createdById` FK constraints\n- Clear dependent tables before parent tables (delete in reverse order of creation)\n\n### Elysia Module Patterns\n- Modules live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/`\n- Each module has `{module}.controller.ts` for Elysia endpoints\n- Each module has `index.ts` for re-exports\n- Controllers use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/{module}\" })` for route grouping\n- Register modules in `apps/server/src/index.ts` with `.use(moduleController)`\n- Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @acme/server check-types`\n\n### Service Patterns\n- Service files live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/{module}.service.ts`\n- Export service and types from module `index.ts`\n- Use plain object with methods for services (not class-based)\n- Define local types for enum values to avoid import issues from zen-v3 generated files (enums are in models.ts but not exported from package index)\n\n### Elysia Controller Patterns\n- Use `auth: true` macro to require authentication on endpoints\n- Access `user` and `session` from handler context when authenticated\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth defaults\n- Use `db` directly for read-only or non-auth-dependent queries\n- Define input schemas with `t.Object({...})` at top of file\n- Use `t.Number({ minimum: X, maximum: Y })` for range validation\n- Return error responses with `status(404, { error: \"...\" })`\n- Define response schemas for 200, 400, 404, 409 etc.\n\n### React Form Component Patterns\n- Forms live in `apps/web/src/components/{module}/{form-name}.tsx`\n- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook\n- UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n- Use `useMemo` to derive computed values from props\n- Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` for reactive calculations\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for form data and props\n- Export component from module `index.ts`\n\n### Form Validation Patterns\n- Use Zod validators with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n- Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` for custom error messages (not `required_error`)\n- Display errors with `field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => <p>{error?.message}</p>)`\n- Error styling: `className={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}`\n- Mark required fields with asterisk in label: `<Label>Field Name *</Label>`\n- Submit button disabled via TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-001\n- **What was implemented:** Added all gas consumption related models to schema.zmodel\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel` - Added enums, models, and relations\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/` - Generated TypeScript files\n- **Models added:**\n  - Enums: EquipmentType, ConsumptionUnit, LineStatusValue, ConsumptionSource\n  - GasUnit, GasEquipment, GasEquipmentConstant\n  - GasDailyEntry, GasLineStatus\n  - GasDailyPlan, GasRealConsumption, GasContract\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - ZenStack uses `pnpm run db:generate` from root to generate TypeScript client\n    - Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n### ZenStack Database Commands\n- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-002\n- **What was implemented:** Ran database generation and pushed schema to database\n- **Commands executed:**\n  - `pnpm run db:generate` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Generated TypeScript files successfully\n  -

gas_daily_plans, gas_real_consumption, gas_contracts\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Run `db:generate` and `db:push` from the `packages/zen-v3/` directory directly\n    - The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n---\n\n## ✓ Iteration 1 -

not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-008\n- **What was implemented:** Added form validation and auto-calculation with manual override\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - Added validators, error display, and QDS override\n- **Features:**\n  - Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 - US-008: Add form validation and auto-calculation\n*2026-01-20T03:58:31.890Z (317s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ne `onSubmit` validator\\n- [x] **QDS value updates as user changes inputs** - Was already implemented (form.Subscribe with reactive calculation)\\n- [x] **Manual override option available for QDS** - Added toggle switch with manual value input field\\n- [x] **Visual feedback on validation errors** - Red border (`border-destructive`) and error messages displayed\\n- [x] **Submit button disabled when form invalid** - Uses TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\\n\\nAll acceptance criteria have been met.\\n\\n\n\n---\n","numLines":319,"startLine":1,"totalLines":319}}}

It's automatically updated\nafter each iteration and included in agent prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### ZenStack Model Patterns\n- Use `@id @default(dbgenerated(\"uuidv7()\"))` for primary keys\n- Use `@default(auth().organizationId)` for organization-scoped models\n- Use `@default(auth().userId)` for audit fields\n- Use `@@map(\"table_name\")` for PostgreSQL table naming (snake_case)\n- Use `@@unique([field1, field2])` for composite unique constraints\n- Access policies: `@@allow('create', auth() != null)` for authenticated users\n- Use named relations like `@relation(\"relationName\")` when a User model has multiple relations to the same model (e.g., createdBy, updatedBy)\n- DateTime date-only fields use `@db.Date` annotation\n\n### Seed Script Patterns\n- Seed scripts live in `apps/server/` (e.g., `seed.ts`, `seed-gas.ts`)\n- Run with `pnpm --filter @acme/server db:seed` or `db:seed-gas`\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth-dependent defaults\n- Always fetch a real user from DB when seeding models with `createdById` FK constraints\n- Clear dependent tables before parent tables (delete in reverse order of creation)\n\n### Elysia Module Patterns\n- Modules live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/`\n- Each module has `{module}.controller.ts` for Elysia endpoints\n- Each module has `index.ts` for re-exports\n- Controllers use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/{module}\" })` for route grouping\n- Register modules in `apps/server/src/index.ts` with `.use(moduleController)`\n- Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @acme/server check-types`\n\n### Service Patterns\n- Service files live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/{module}.service.ts`\n- Export service and types from module `index.ts`\n- Use plain object with methods for services (not class-based)\n- Define local types for enum values to avoid import issues from zen-v3 generated files (enums are in models.ts but not exported from package index)\n\n### Elysia Controller Patterns\n- Use `auth: true` macro to require authentication on endpoints\n- Access `user` and `session` from handler context when authenticated\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth defaults\n- Use `db` directly for read-only or non-auth-dependent queries\n- Define input schemas with `t.Object({...})` at top of file\n- Use `t.Number({ minimum: X, maximum: Y })` for range validation\n- Return error responses with `status(404, { error: \"...\" })`\n- Define response schemas for 200, 400, 404, 409 etc.\n\n### React Form Component Patterns\n- Forms live in `apps/web/src/components/{module}/{form-name}.tsx`\n- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook\n- UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n- Use `useMemo` to derive computed values from props\n- Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` for reactive calculations\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for form data and props\n- Export component from module `index.ts`\n\n### Form Validation Patterns\n- Use Zod validators with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n- Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` for custom error messages (not `required_error`)\n- Display errors with `field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => <p>{error?.message}</p>)`\n- Error styling: `className={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}`\n- Mark required fields with asterisk in label: `<Label>Field Name *</Label>`\n- Submit button disabled via TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-001\n- **What was implemented:** Added all gas consumption related models to schema.zmodel\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel` - Added enums, models, and relations\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/` - Generated TypeScript files\n- **Models added:**\n  - Enums: EquipmentType, ConsumptionUnit, LineStatusValue, ConsumptionSource\n  - GasUnit, GasEquipment, GasEquipmentConstant\n  - GasDailyEntry, GasLineStatus\n  - GasDailyPlan, GasRealConsumption, GasContract\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - ZenStack uses `pnpm run db:generate` from root to generate TypeScript client\n    - Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n### ZenStack Database Commands\n- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-002\n- **What was implemented:** Ran database generation and pushed schema to database\n- **Commands executed:**\n  - `pnpm run db:generate` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Generated TypeScript files successfully\n  - `pnpm run db:push` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Applied schema to PostgreSQL database\n- **Files affected:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/schema.ts` - Regenerated with all gas models\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/models.ts` - Regenerated\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/input.ts` - Regenerated\n- **Database tables created:**\n  - gas_units, gas_equipment, gas_equipment_constants\n  - gas_daily_entries, gas_line_status\n  - gas_daily_plans, gas_real_consumption, gas_contracts\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Run `db:generate` and `db:push` from the `packages/zen-v3/` directory directly\n    - The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n---\n\n## ✓ Iteration 1 - US-001: Add ZenStack models to schema.zmodel\n*2026-01-20T03:29:45.310Z (299s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nunitId+date\\n- [x] LineStatus model (GasLineStatus) with entry and equipment relations\\n- [x] DailyPlan model (GasDailyPlan) with approval workflow fields (submitted, approved, rejectionReason, etc.)\\n- [x] RealConsumption model (GasRealConsumption) with source tracking (ConsumptionSource enum)\\n- [x] Contract model (GasContract) with tolerance band fields (transportToleranceUpperPercent, transportToleranceLowerPercent, moleculeTolerancePercent)\\n- [x] Access policies defined for all models\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 -

Botucatu (BOT): ATM 250 (2,500 m³/h), ATM 052 (520 m³/h), 2 lines (300 m³/h each), Secador 2 (800 m³/h)\n  - **Contract:** QDC 134,800 m³/d with tolerance bands (+10%/-20% transport, ±5% molecule)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Seed scripts follow pattern in `apps/server/seed.ts`\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` with a real userId for models with `createdById` foreign key\n    - The `db` client is used for models without auth-dependent defaults\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Empty userId in auth context causes FK constraint violation for `createdById` fields\n    - Must get a real user from DB for seed operations that create records with audit fields\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 2 - US-002: Run database generation and migration\n*2026-01-20T03:31:58.816Z (132s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ny** - `pnpm run db:generate` completed in 283ms\\n- ✅ **Database schema updated with new tables** - `pnpm run db:push` synced the database with the Prisma schema\\n- ✅ **No migration errors** - Both commands completed successfully, typecheck passed\\n\\nNote: Since US-002 is about running database commands (which don't produce file changes to commit), and the generated files were already committed in US-001, there are no new files to commit. The database has been updated with the new gas tables.\\n\\n\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 3 - US-003: Create seed script for units and equipment\n*2026-01-20T03:35:35.345Z (216s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nes 1-2)\\n- [x] **Botucatu unit created with code BOT and equipment** (ATM 250, ATM 052, Lines 1-2, Secador 2)\\n- [x] **Equipment constants set with correct consumption rates** (m³/h for each equipment)\\n- [x] **Default contract created with QDC 134,800 m³/d and tolerance bands** (+10%/-20% transport, ±5% molecule)\\n\\n**Files changed:**\\n- `apps/server/seed-gas.ts` -

`apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - New Elysia controller with `/gas` prefix\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/index.ts` - Re-export for cleaner imports\n  - `apps/server/src/index.ts` - Registered gasController in main app\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Modules follow `{module}.controller.ts` + `index.ts` pattern\n    - Use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/modulename\" })` for route grouping\n    - Import `betterAuth` plugin in controllers needing authentication\n    - Register modules with `.use(controller)` in main app\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Server package uses `check-types` script (not `typecheck`)\n    - ESLint not configured for server package (skip lint for now)\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 4 - US-004: Set up gas module structure in server\n*2026-01-20T03:38:29.783Z (173s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nts` -

Set up gas module structure in server`\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-005\n- **What was implemented:** Created GasCalculationService with gas consumption calculation methods\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.service.ts` - New service with calculation methods\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/index.ts` - Updated to export service and types\n- **Methods implemented:**\n  - `calculateQdcAtomizer`: Calculates atomizer consumption, handles single and dual atomizer scenarios\n  - `calculateQdcLines`: Sums consumption for lines with ON status only\n  - `calculateQds`: Combines atomizer and lines consumption\n  - `calculateDeviations`: Computes transport and molecule tolerance deviations with status\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Services use plain object with methods pattern (not class-based)\n    - Service files follow `{module}.service.ts` naming convention\n    - Types exported alongside service for external consumption\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - ZenStack enums (like `LineStatusValue`, `EquipmentType`) are generated in `models.ts` but not exported from the zen-v3 package index\n    - Define local type aliases matching enum values to avoid import issues\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 5 - US-005: Implement GasCalculationService\n*2026-01-20T03:42:14.044Z (223s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns 131-143 filter by `status === \\\"on\\\"` and sum consumption\\n- ✅ **calculateQds method combines atomizer and lines consumption** - Lines 154-156 simply adds both values\\n- ✅ **calculateDeviations method computes transport and molecule tolerances** - Lines 174-226 calculate upper/lower limits for both tolerance types\\n- ✅ **Deviation status (within/exceeded) correctly determined** - Transport has 3 states (`within`, `exceeded_upper`, `exceeded_lower`) and molecule has 2 (`within`, `exceeded`)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-006\n- **What was implemented:** Created daily entry API endpoints with validation and auto-calculation\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints\n- **Endpoints implemented:**\n  - `POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries` - Create new daily entry with validation\n  - `GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries?month=YYYY-MM` - Get entries for a month\n- **Features:**\n  - Hours validation (0-24 range) via Elysia schema\n  - Equipment ID validation (must belong to unit)\n  - Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\n  - Line statuses populated with equipment info on GET\n  - Duplicate entry prevention (unique constraint on unitId+date)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `t.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 24 })` for range validation in Elysia\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` in controller handlers for models with auth defaults\n    - Use `db` (not authDb) for read-only queries or models without auth defaults\n    - Include relations with `include: { relation: { include: { nested: true } } }`\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Array destructuring with `.map(Number)` needs null coalescing for TypeScript\n    - Use `parts[0] ?? 0` instead of direct destructuring `[year, month]`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 6 - US-006: Create daily entry API endpoints\n*2026-01-20T03:45:39.981Z (205s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nodules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints with full validation and response schemas\\n\\n### Acceptance Criteria Met\\n- ✅ POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries creates new entry with validation\\n- ✅ Entry validation ensures hours 0-24, valid equipment IDs\\n- ✅ Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\\n- ✅ GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries returns entries for a month\\n- ✅ Query parameter month in YYYY-MM format\\n- ✅ Entries returned with line statuses populated\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-007\n- **What was implemented:** Built unit entry form component for daily gas data entry\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - New form component with all required fields\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/index.ts` - Export file for gas components\n- **Features:**\n  - Date picker with auto-populated today's date\n  - Atomizer scheduled toggle (Yes/No) with hours input\n  - Secondary atomizer fields conditionally shown for units with 2+ atomizers (Botucatu)\n  - Production line toggles dynamically rendered based on unit equipment\n  - Observations text field\n  - Real-time QDS calculation displayed with breakdown (atomizer + lines + total)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Follow existing form patterns from `products/product-form.tsx` and `clients/client-form.tsx`\n    - Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook for form state\n    - UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n    - Use `useMemo` to extract equipment subsets (atomizers, lines) from unit data\n    - Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` prop for reactive calculations\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Avoid complex zod validators with `z.record(z.enum())` - causes type issues with TanStack Form\n    - For nested Record fields, use single `form.Field` with `handleChange` on full object\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, ui editor) - not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-008\n- **What was implemented:** Added form validation and auto-calculation with manual override\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - Added validators, error display, and QDS override\n- **Features:**\n  - Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 -

It's automatically updated\nafter each iteration and included in agent prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### ZenStack Model Patterns\n- Use `@id @default(dbgenerated(\"uuidv7()\"))` for primary keys\n- Use `@default(auth().organizationId)` for organization-scoped models\n- Use `@default(auth().userId)` for audit fields\n- Use `@@map(\"table_name\")` for PostgreSQL table naming (snake_case)\n- Use `@@unique([field1, field2])` for composite unique constraints\n- Access policies: `@@allow('create', auth() != null)` for authenticated users\n- Use named relations like `@relation(\"relationName\")` when a User model has multiple relations to the same model (e.g., createdBy, updatedBy)\n- DateTime date-only fields use `@db.Date` annotation\n\n### Seed Script Patterns\n- Seed scripts live in `apps/server/` (e.g., `seed.ts`, `seed-gas.ts`)\n- Run with `pnpm --filter @acme/server db:seed` or `db:seed-gas`\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth-dependent defaults\n- Always fetch a real user from DB when seeding models with `createdById` FK constraints\n- Clear dependent tables before parent tables (delete in reverse order of creation)\n\n### Elysia Module Patterns\n- Modules live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/`\n- Each module has `{module}.controller.ts` for Elysia endpoints\n- Each module has `index.ts` for re-exports\n- Controllers use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/{module}\" })` for route grouping\n- Register modules in `apps/server/src/index.ts` with `.use(moduleController)`\n- Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @acme/server check-types`\n\n### Service Patterns\n- Service files live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/{module}.service.ts`\n- Export service and types from module `index.ts`\n- Use plain object with methods for services (not class-based)\n- Define local types for enum values to avoid import issues from zen-v3 generated files (enums are in models.ts but not exported from package index)\n\n### Elysia Controller Patterns\n- Use `auth: true` macro to require authentication on endpoints\n- Access `user` and `session` from handler context when authenticated\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth defaults\n- Use `db` directly for read-only or non-auth-dependent queries\n- Define input schemas with `t.Object({...})` at top of file\n- Use `t.Number({ minimum: X, maximum: Y })` for range validation\n- Return error responses with `status(404, { error: \"...\" })`\n- Define response schemas for 200, 400, 404, 409 etc.\n\n### React Form Component Patterns\n- Forms live in `apps/web/src/components/{module}/{form-name}.tsx`\n- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook\n- UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n- Use `useMemo` to derive computed values from props\n- Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` for reactive calculations\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for form data and props\n- Export component from module `index.ts`\n\n### Form Validation Patterns\n- Use Zod validators with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n- Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` for custom error messages (not `required_error`)\n- Display errors with `field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => <p>{error?.message}</p>)`\n- Error styling: `className={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}`\n- Mark required fields with asterisk in label: `<Label>Field Name *</Label>`\n- Submit button disabled via TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-001\n- **What was implemented:** Added all gas consumption related models to schema.zmodel\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel` - Added enums, models, and relations\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/` - Generated TypeScript files\n- **Models added:**\n  - Enums: EquipmentType, ConsumptionUnit, LineStatusValue, ConsumptionSource\n  - GasUnit, GasEquipment, GasEquipmentConstant\n  - GasDailyEntry, GasLineStatus\n  - GasDailyPlan, GasRealConsumption, GasContract\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - ZenStack uses `pnpm run db:generate` from root to generate TypeScript client\n    - Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n### ZenStack Database Commands\n- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-002\n- **What was implemented:** Ran database generation and pushed schema to database\n- **Commands executed:**\n  - `pnpm run db:generate` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Generated TypeScript files successfully\n  - `pnpm run db:push` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Applied schema to PostgreSQL database\n- **Files affected:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/schema.ts` - Regenerated with all gas models\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/models.ts` - Regenerated\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/input.ts` - Regenerated\n- **Database tables created:**\n  - gas_units, gas_equipment, gas_equipment_constants\n  - gas_daily_entries, gas_line_status\n  - gas_daily_plans, gas_real_consumption, gas_contracts\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Run `db:generate` and `db:push` from the `packages/zen-v3/` directory directly\n    - The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n---\n\n## ✓ Iteration 1 -

`calculateQdcLines`: Sums consumption for lines with ON status only\n  - `calculateQds`: Combines atomizer and lines consumption\n  - `calculateDeviations`: Computes transport and molecule tolerance deviations with status\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Services use plain object with methods pattern (not class-based)\n    - Service files follow `{module}.service.ts` naming convention\n    - Types exported alongside service for external consumption\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - ZenStack enums (like `LineStatusValue`, `EquipmentType`) are generated in `models.ts` but not exported from the zen-v3 package index\n    - Define local type aliases matching enum values to avoid import issues\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 5 - US-005: Implement GasCalculationService\n*2026-01-20T03:42:14.044Z (223s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns 131-143 filter by `status === \\\"on\\\"` and sum consumption\\n- ✅ **calculateQds method combines atomizer and lines consumption** - Lines 154-156 simply adds both values\\n- ✅ **calculateDeviations method computes transport and molecule tolerances** - Lines 174-226 calculate upper/lower limits for both tolerance types\\n- ✅ **Deviation status (within/exceeded) correctly determined** - Transport has 3 states (`within`, `exceeded_upper`, `exceeded_lower`) and molecule has 2 (`within`, `exceeded`)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-006\n- **What was implemented:** Created daily entry API endpoints with validation and auto-calculation\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints\n- **Endpoints implemented:**\n  - `POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries` - Create new daily entry with validation\n  - `GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries?month=YYYY-MM` - Get entries for a month\n- **Features:**\n  - Hours validation (0-24 range) via Elysia schema\n  - Equipment ID validation (must belong to unit)\n  - Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\n  - Line statuses populated with equipment info on GET\n  - Duplicate entry prevention (unique constraint on unitId+date)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `t.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 24 })` for range validation in Elysia\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` in controller handlers for models with auth defaults\n    - Use `db` (not authDb) for read-only queries or models without auth defaults\n    - Include relations with `include: { relation: { include: { nested: true } } }`\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Array destructuring with `.map(Number)` needs null coalescing for TypeScript\n    - Use `parts[0] ?? 0` instead of direct destructuring `[year, month]`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 6 - US-006: Create daily entry API endpoints\n*2026-01-20T03:45:39.981Z (205s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nodules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints with full validation and response schemas\\n\\n### Acceptance Criteria Met\\n- ✅ POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries creates new entry with validation\\n- ✅ Entry validation ensures hours 0-24, valid equipment IDs\\n- ✅ Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\\n- ✅ GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries returns entries for a month\\n- ✅ Query parameter month in YYYY-MM format\\n- ✅ Entries returned with line statuses populated\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-007\n- **What was implemented:** Built unit entry form component for daily gas data entry\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - New form component with all required fields\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/index.ts` - Export file for gas components\n- **Features:**\n  - Date picker with auto-populated today's date\n  - Atomizer scheduled toggle (Yes/No) with hours input\n  - Secondary atomizer fields conditionally shown for units with 2+ atomizers (Botucatu)\n  - Production line toggles dynamically rendered based on unit equipment\n  - Observations text field\n  - Real-time QDS calculation displayed with breakdown (atomizer + lines + total)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Follow existing form patterns from `products/product-form.tsx` and `clients/client-form.tsx`\n    - Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook for form state\n    - UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n    - Use `useMemo` to extract equipment subsets (atomizers, lines) from unit data\n    - Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` prop for reactive calculations\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Avoid complex zod validators with `z.record(z.enum())` - causes type issues with TanStack Form\n    - For nested Record fields, use single `form.Field` with `handleChange` on full object\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, ui editor) - not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n### TanStack Router Route Patterns\n- Protected routes go under `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/{module}/`\n- Each module has `layout.tsx` (with `Outlet`) and `index.tsx`\n- Route path naming: `createFileRoute(\"/_authenticated/{module}/\")` for index routes\n- Feature components live in `apps/web/src/features/{module}/index.tsx`\n- Use Breadcrumb components from `@acme/ui/breadcrumb` with TanStack Router's `Link`\n- Header component pattern: Breadcrumb + `ms-auto` div for right-aligned controls\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-008\n- **What was implemented:** Added form validation and auto-calculation with manual override\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - Added validators, error display, and QDS override\n- **Features:**\n  - Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 - US-008: Add form validation and auto-calculation\n*2026-01-20T03:58:31.890Z (317s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ne `onSubmit` validator\\n- [x] **QDS value updates as user changes inputs** -
