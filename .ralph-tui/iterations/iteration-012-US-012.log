Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    95→    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n    96→  - Gotchas encountered:\n    97→    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    98→    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n    99→### ZenStack Database Commands\n   100→- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n   101→- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n   102→- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n   103→\n   104→---\n   105→\n   106→## 2026-01-20 -

The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n   123→    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n   124→  - Gotchas encountered:\n   125→    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n   126→    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n   127→---\n   128→\n   129→## ✓ Iteration 1 - US-001: Add ZenStack models to schema.zmodel\n   130→*2026-01-20T03:29:45.310Z (299s)*\n   131→\n   132→**Status:** Completed\n   133→\n   134→**Notes:**\n   135→unitId+date\\n- [x] LineStatus model (GasLineStatus) with entry and equipment relations\\n- [x] DailyPlan model (GasDailyPlan) with approval workflow fields (submitted, approved, rejectionReason, etc.)\\n- [x] RealConsumption model (GasRealConsumption) with source tracking (ConsumptionSource enum)\\n- [x] Contract model (GasContract) with tolerance band fields (transportToleranceUpperPercent, transportToleranceLowerPercent, moleculeTolerancePercent)\\n- [x] Access policies defined for all models\\n\\n\n   136→\n   137→---\n   138→\n   139→## 2026-01-20 -

It's automatically updated\nafter each iteration and included in agent prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### ZenStack Model Patterns\n- Use `@id @default(dbgenerated(\"uuidv7()\"))` for primary keys\n- Use `@default(auth().organizationId)` for organization-scoped models\n- Use `@default(auth().userId)` for audit fields\n- Use `@@map(\"table_name\")` for PostgreSQL table naming (snake_case)\n- Use `@@unique([field1, field2])` for composite unique constraints\n- Access policies: `@@allow('create', auth() != null)` for authenticated users\n- Use named relations like `@relation(\"relationName\")` when a User model has multiple relations to the same model (e.g., createdBy, updatedBy)\n- DateTime date-only fields use `@db.Date` annotation\n\n### Seed Script Patterns\n- Seed scripts live in `apps/server/` (e.g., `seed.ts`, `seed-gas.ts`)\n- Run with `pnpm --filter @acme/server db:seed` or `db:seed-gas`\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth-dependent defaults\n- Always fetch a real user from DB when seeding models with `createdById` FK constraints\n- Clear dependent tables before parent tables (delete in reverse order of creation)\n\n### Elysia Module Patterns\n- Modules live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/`\n- Each module has `{module}.controller.ts` for Elysia endpoints\n- Each module has `index.ts` for re-exports\n- Controllers use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/{module}\" })` for route grouping\n- Register modules in `apps/server/src/index.ts` with `.use(moduleController)`\n- Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @acme/server check-types`\n\n### Service Patterns\n- Service files live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/{module}.service.ts`\n- Export service and types from module `index.ts`\n- Use plain object with methods for services (not class-based)\n- Define local types for enum values to avoid import issues from zen-v3 generated files (enums are in models.ts but not exported from package index)\n\n### Elysia Controller Patterns\n- Use `auth: true` macro to require authentication on endpoints\n- Access `user` and `session` from handler context when authenticated\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth defaults\n- Use `db` directly for read-only or non-auth-dependent queries\n- Define input schemas with `t.Object({...})` at top of file\n- Use `t.Number({ minimum: X, maximum: Y })` for range validation\n- Return error responses with `status(404, { error: \"...\" })`\n- Define response schemas for 200, 400, 404, 409 etc.\n\n### React Form Component Patterns\n- Forms live in `apps/web/src/components/{module}/{form-name}.tsx`\n- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook\n- UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n- Use `useMemo` to derive computed values from props\n- Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` for reactive calculations\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for form data and props\n- Export component from module `index.ts`\n\n### Form Validation Patterns\n- Use Zod validators with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n- Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` for custom error messages (not `required_error`)\n- Display errors with `field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => <p>{error?.message}</p>)`\n- Error styling: `className={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}`\n- Mark required fields with asterisk in label: `<Label>Field Name *</Label>`\n- Submit button disabled via TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\n\n### Elysia Treaty API Client Patterns\n- Import API client: `import { api } from \"~/clients/api-client\"`\n- Call endpoints: `api.{module}.{endpoint}.get({ query: {...} })` or `.post({ body: {...} })`\n- Use `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching\n- Error handling: cast `response.error as { error?: string }` due to complex union types\n- Query key pattern: `[\"module\", \"action\", ...params]`\n\n### Dashboard Card Styling Patterns\n- Use `border-l-4 border-l-{color}-500` for colored left borders\n- Match icon color with `text-{color}-500` class\n- Format Brazilian numbers: `value.toLocaleString(\"pt-BR\")`\n- Card grid: `grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 -

Patterns discovered:\n    - Seed scripts follow pattern in `apps/server/seed.ts`\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` with a real userId for models with `createdById` foreign key\n    - The `db` client is used for models without auth-dependent defaults\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Empty userId in auth context causes FK constraint violation for `createdById` fields\n    - Must get a real user from DB for seed operations that create records with audit fields\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 2 - US-002: Run database generation and migration\n*2026-01-20T03:31:58.816Z (132s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ny** - `pnpm run db:generate` completed in 283ms\\n- ✅ **Database schema updated with new tables** - `pnpm run db:push` synced the database with the Prisma schema\\n- ✅ **No migration errors** - Both commands completed successfully, typecheck passed\\n\\nNote: Since US-002 is about running database commands (which don't produce file changes to commit), and the generated files were already committed in US-001, there are no new files to commit. The database has been updated with the new gas tables.\\n\\n\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 3 - US-003: Create seed script for units and equipment\n*2026-01-20T03:35:35.345Z (216s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nes 1-2)\\n- [x] **Botucatu unit created with code BOT and equipment** (ATM 250, ATM 052, Lines 1-2, Secador 2)\\n- [x] **Equipment constants set with correct consumption rates** (m³/h for each equipment)\\n- [x] **Default contract created with QDC 134,800 m³/d and tolerance bands** (+10%/-20% transport, ±5% molecule)\\n\\n**Files changed:**\\n- `apps/server/seed-gas.ts` -

`apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.service.ts` - New service with calculation methods\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/index.ts` - Updated to export service and types\n- **Methods implemented:**\n  - `calculateQdcAtomizer`: Calculates atomizer consumption, handles single and dual atomizer scenarios\n  - `calculateQdcLines`: Sums consumption for lines with ON status only\n  - `calculateQds`: Combines atomizer and lines consumption\n  - `calculateDeviations`: Computes transport and molecule tolerance deviations with status\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Services use plain object with methods pattern (not class-based)\n    - Service files follow `{module}.service.ts` naming convention\n    - Types exported alongside service for external consumption\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - ZenStack enums (like `LineStatusValue`, `EquipmentType`) are generated in `models.ts` but not exported from the zen-v3 package index\n    - Define local type aliases matching enum values to avoid import issues\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 5 - US-005: Implement GasCalculationService\n*2026-01-20T03:42:14.044Z (223s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns 131-143 filter by `status === \\\"on\\\"` and sum consumption\\n- ✅ **calculateQds method combines atomizer and lines consumption** - Lines 154-156 simply adds both values\\n- ✅ **calculateDeviations method computes transport and molecule tolerances** - Lines 174-226 calculate upper/lower limits for both tolerance types\\n- ✅ **Deviation status (within/exceeded) correctly determined** - Transport has 3 states (`within`, `exceeded_upper`, `exceeded_lower`) and molecule has 2 (`within`, `exceeded`)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-006\n- **What was implemented:** Created daily entry API endpoints with validation and auto-calculation\n- **Files changed:**\n  -

Line statuses populated with equipment info on GET\n  - Duplicate entry prevention (unique constraint on unitId+date)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `t.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 24 })` for range validation in Elysia\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` in controller handlers for models with auth defaults\n    - Use `db` (not authDb) for read-only queries or models without auth defaults\n    - Include relations with `include: { relation: { include: { nested: true } } }`\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Array destructuring with `.map(Number)` needs null coalescing for TypeScript\n    - Use `parts[0] ?? 0` instead of direct destructuring `[year, month]`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 6 - US-006: Create daily entry API endpoints\n*2026-01-20T03:45:39.981Z (205s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nodules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints with full validation and response schemas\\n\\n### Acceptance Criteria Met\\n- ✅ POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries creates new entry with validation\\n- ✅ Entry validation ensures hours 0-24, valid equipment IDs\\n- ✅ Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\\n- ✅ GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries returns entries for a month\\n- ✅ Query parameter month in YYYY-MM format\\n- ✅ Entries returned with line statuses populated\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-007\n- **What was implemented:** Built unit entry form component for daily gas data entry\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - New form component with all required fields\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/index.ts` - Export file for gas components\n- **Features:**\n  - Date picker with auto-populated today's date\n  - Atomizer scheduled toggle (Yes/No) with hours input\n  - Secondary atomizer fields conditionally shown for units with 2+ atomizers (Botucatu)\n  - Production line toggles dynamically rendered based on unit equipment\n  - Observations text field\n  - Real-time QDS calculation displayed with breakdown (atomizer + lines + total)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Follow existing form patterns from `products/product-form.tsx` and `clients/client-form.tsx`\n    - Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook for form state\n    - UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n    - Use `useMemo` to extract equipment subsets (atomizers, lines) from unit data\n    - Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` prop for reactive calculations\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Avoid complex zod validators with `z.record(z.enum())` - causes type issues with TanStack Form\n    - For nested Record fields, use single `form.Field` with `handleChange` on full object\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, ui editor) - not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n### TanStack Router Route Patterns\n- Protected routes go under `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/{module}/`\n- Each module has `layout.tsx` (with `Outlet`) and `index.tsx`\n- Route path naming: `createFileRoute(\"/_authenticated/{module}/\")` for index routes\n- Feature components live in `apps/web/src/features/{module}/index.tsx`\n- Use Breadcrumb components from `@acme/ui/breadcrumb` with TanStack Router's `Link`\n- Header component pattern: Breadcrumb + `ms-auto` div for right-aligned controls\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 -

Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 -

Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `session.activeOrganizationId` from auth context for organization-scoped queries\n    - Filter related models by organization using nested `where: { unit: { organizationId: ... } }`\n    - Use `t.Union([t.Literal(\"a\"), t.Literal(\"b\")])` for enum-like response types in Elysia\n    - Use Record type for grouping data by date key, then convert to array with Object.values()\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Contract lookup needs OR condition for effectiveTo: `OR: [{ effectiveTo: null }, { effectiveTo: { gte: startDate } }]`\n    - When using `for...in` loop on Record, TypeScript narrowing doesn't automatically type the value\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 10 -

It's automatically updated\nafter each iteration and included in agent prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### ZenStack Model Patterns\n- Use `@id @default(dbgenerated(\"uuidv7()\"))` for primary keys\n- Use `@default(auth().organizationId)` for organization-scoped models\n- Use `@default(auth().userId)` for audit fields\n- Use `@@map(\"table_name\")` for PostgreSQL table naming (snake_case)\n- Use `@@unique([field1, field2])` for composite unique constraints\n- Access policies: `@@allow('create', auth() != null)` for authenticated users\n- Use named relations like `@relation(\"relationName\")` when a User model has multiple relations to the same model (e.g., createdBy, updatedBy)\n- DateTime date-only fields use `@db.Date` annotation\n\n### Seed Script Patterns\n- Seed scripts live in `apps/server/` (e.g., `seed.ts`, `seed-gas.ts`)\n- Run with `pnpm --filter @acme/server db:seed` or `db:seed-gas`\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth-dependent defaults\n- Always fetch a real user from DB when seeding models with `createdById` FK constraints\n- Clear dependent tables before parent tables (delete in reverse order of creation)\n\n### Elysia Module Patterns\n- Modules live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/`\n- Each module has `{module}.controller.ts` for Elysia endpoints\n- Each module has `index.ts` for re-exports\n- Controllers use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/{module}\" })` for route grouping\n- Register modules in `apps/server/src/index.ts` with `.use(moduleController)`\n- Typecheck with `pnpm --filter @acme/server check-types`\n\n### Service Patterns\n- Service files live in `apps/server/src/modules/{module-name}/{module}.service.ts`\n- Export service and types from module `index.ts`\n- Use plain object with methods for services (not class-based)\n- Define local types for enum values to avoid import issues from zen-v3 generated files (enums are in models.ts but not exported from package index)\n\n### Elysia Controller Patterns\n- Use `auth: true` macro to require authentication on endpoints\n- Access `user` and `session` from handler context when authenticated\n- Use `authDb.$setAuth({ userId, organizationId, ... })` for models with auth defaults\n- Use `db` directly for read-only or non-auth-dependent queries\n- Define input schemas with `t.Object({...})` at top of file\n- Use `t.Number({ minimum: X, maximum: Y })` for range validation\n- Return error responses with `status(404, { error: \"...\" })`\n- Define response schemas for 200, 400, 404, 409 etc.\n\n### React Form Component Patterns\n- Forms live in `apps/web/src/components/{module}/{form-name}.tsx`\n- Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook\n- UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n- Use `useMemo` to derive computed values from props\n- Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` for reactive calculations\n- Define TypeScript interfaces for form data and props\n- Export component from module `index.ts`\n\n### Form Validation Patterns\n- Use Zod validators with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n- Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` for custom error messages (not `required_error`)\n- Display errors with `field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => <p>{error?.message}</p>)`\n- Error styling: `className={field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}`\n- Mark required fields with asterisk in label: `<Label>Field Name *</Label>`\n- Submit button disabled via TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\n\n### Elysia Treaty API Client Patterns\n- Import API client: `import { api } from \"~/clients/api-client\"`\n- Call endpoints: `api.{module}.{endpoint}.get({ query: {...} })` or `.post({ body: {...} })`\n- Use `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching\n- Error handling: cast `response.error as { error?: string }` due to complex union types\n- Query key pattern: `[\"module\", \"action\", ...params]`\n\n### Dashboard Card Styling Patterns\n- Use `border-l-4 border-l-{color}-500` for colored left borders\n- Match icon color with `text-{color}-500` class\n- Format Brazilian numbers: `value.toLocaleString(\"pt-BR\")`\n- Card grid: `grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-001\n- **What was implemented:** Added all gas consumption related models to schema.zmodel\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel` - Added enums, models, and relations\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/` - Generated TypeScript files\n- **Models added:**\n  - Enums: EquipmentType, ConsumptionUnit, LineStatusValue, ConsumptionSource\n  - GasUnit, GasEquipment, GasEquipmentConstant\n  - GasDailyEntry, GasLineStatus\n  - GasDailyPlan, GasRealConsumption, GasContract\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - ZenStack uses `pnpm run db:generate` from root to generate TypeScript client\n    - Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n### ZenStack Database Commands\n- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-002\n- **What was implemented:** Ran database generation and pushed schema to database\n- **Commands executed:**\n  - `pnpm run db:generate` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Generated TypeScript files successfully\n  - `pnpm run db:push` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Applied schema to PostgreSQL database\n- **Files affected:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/schema.ts` - Regenerated with all gas models\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/models.ts` - Regenerated\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/input.ts` - Regenerated\n- **Database tables created:**\n  - gas_units, gas_equipment, gas_equipment_constants\n  - gas_daily_entries, gas_line_status\n  - gas_daily_plans, gas_real_consumption, gas_contracts\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Run `db:generate` and `db:push` from the `packages/zen-v3/` directory directly\n    - The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n---\n\n## ✓ Iteration 1 - US-001: Add ZenStack models to schema.zmodel\n*2026-01-20T03:29:45.310Z (299s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nunitId+date\\n- [x] LineStatus model (GasLineStatus) with entry and equipment relations\\n- [x] DailyPlan model (GasDailyPlan) with approval workflow fields (submitted, approved, rejectionReason, etc.)\\n- [x] RealConsumption model (GasRealConsumption) with source tracking (ConsumptionSource enum)\\n- [x] Contract model (GasContract) with tolerance band fields (transportToleranceUpperPercent, transportToleranceLowerPercent, moleculeTolerancePercent)\\n- [x] Access policies defined for all models\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-003\n- **What was implemented:** Created seed script for gas units and equipment\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/seed-gas.ts` - New seed script for gas data\n  - `apps/server/package.json` - Added `db:seed-gas` script\n- **Data seeded:**\n  - **Units (3):**\n    - Criciúma (CRI): 1 atomizer (1,500 m³/h) + 8 lines 0-7 (250 m³/h each)\n    - Urussanga (URU): 1 atomizer (1,200 m³/h) + 2 lines 1-2 (200 m³/h each)\n    - Botucatu (BOT): ATM 250 (2,500 m³/h), ATM 052 (520 m³/h), 2 lines (300 m³/h each), Secador 2 (800 m³/h)\n  - **Contract:** QDC 134,800 m³/d with tolerance bands (+10%/-20% transport, ±5% molecule)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Seed scripts follow pattern in `apps/server/seed.ts`\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` with a real userId for models with `createdById` foreign key\n    - The `db` client is used for models without auth-dependent defaults\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Empty userId in auth context causes FK constraint violation for `createdById` fields\n    - Must get a real user from DB for seed operations that create records with audit fields\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 2 - US-002: Run database generation and migration\n*2026-01-20T03:31:58.816Z (132s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ny** - `pnpm run db:generate` completed in 283ms\\n- ✅ **Database schema updated with new tables** - `pnpm run db:push` synced the database with the Prisma schema\\n- ✅ **No migration errors** - Both commands completed successfully, typecheck passed\\n\\nNote: Since US-002 is about running database commands (which don't produce file changes to commit), and the generated files were already committed in US-001, there are no new files to commit. The database has been updated with the new gas tables.\\n\\n\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 3 - US-003: Create seed script for units and equipment\n*2026-01-20T03:35:35.345Z (216s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nes 1-2)\\n- [x] **Botucatu unit created with code BOT and equipment** (ATM 250, ATM 052, Lines 1-2, Secador 2)\\n- [x] **Equipment constants set with correct consumption rates** (m³/h for each equipment)\\n- [x] **Default contract created with QDC 134,800 m³/d and tolerance bands** (+10%/-20% transport, ±5% molecule)\\n\\n**Files changed:**\\n- `apps/server/seed-gas.ts` -

`apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - New Elysia controller with `/gas` prefix\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/index.ts` - Re-export for cleaner imports\n  - `apps/server/src/index.ts` - Registered gasController in main app\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Modules follow `{module}.controller.ts` + `index.ts` pattern\n    - Use `new Elysia({ prefix: \"/modulename\" })` for route grouping\n    - Import `betterAuth` plugin in controllers needing authentication\n    - Register modules with `.use(controller)` in main app\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Server package uses `check-types` script (not `typecheck`)\n    - ESLint not configured for server package (skip lint for now)\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 4 - US-004: Set up gas module structure in server\n*2026-01-20T03:38:29.783Z (173s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nts` -

Set up gas module structure in server`\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-005\n- **What was implemented:** Created GasCalculationService with gas consumption calculation methods\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.service.ts` - New service with calculation methods\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/index.ts` - Updated to export service and types\n- **Methods implemented:**\n  - `calculateQdcAtomizer`: Calculates atomizer consumption, handles single and dual atomizer scenarios\n  - `calculateQdcLines`: Sums consumption for lines with ON status only\n  - `calculateQds`: Combines atomizer and lines consumption\n  - `calculateDeviations`: Computes transport and molecule tolerance deviations with status\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Services use plain object with methods pattern (not class-based)\n    - Service files follow `{module}.service.ts` naming convention\n    - Types exported alongside service for external consumption\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - ZenStack enums (like `LineStatusValue`, `EquipmentType`) are generated in `models.ts` but not exported from the zen-v3 package index\n    - Define local type aliases matching enum values to avoid import issues\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 5 - US-005: Implement GasCalculationService\n*2026-01-20T03:42:14.044Z (223s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns 131-143 filter by `status === \\\"on\\\"` and sum consumption\\n- ✅ **calculateQds method combines atomizer and lines consumption** - Lines 154-156 simply adds both values\\n- ✅ **calculateDeviations method computes transport and molecule tolerances** - Lines 174-226 calculate upper/lower limits for both tolerance types\\n- ✅ **Deviation status (within/exceeded) correctly determined** - Transport has 3 states (`within`, `exceeded_upper`, `exceeded_lower`) and molecule has 2 (`within`, `exceeded`)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-006\n- **What was implemented:** Created daily entry API endpoints with validation and auto-calculation\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints\n- **Endpoints implemented:**\n  - `POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries` - Create new daily entry with validation\n  - `GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries?month=YYYY-MM` - Get entries for a month\n- **Features:**\n  - Hours validation (0-24 range) via Elysia schema\n  - Equipment ID validation (must belong to unit)\n  - Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\n  - Line statuses populated with equipment info on GET\n  - Duplicate entry prevention (unique constraint on unitId+date)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `t.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 24 })` for range validation in Elysia\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` in controller handlers for models with auth defaults\n    - Use `db` (not authDb) for read-only queries or models without auth defaults\n    - Include relations with `include: { relation: { include: { nested: true } } }`\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Array destructuring with `.map(Number)` needs null coalescing for TypeScript\n    - Use `parts[0] ?? 0` instead of direct destructuring `[year, month]`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 6 - US-006: Create daily entry API endpoints\n*2026-01-20T03:45:39.981Z (205s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nodules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added POST and GET endpoints with full validation and response schemas\\n\\n### Acceptance Criteria Met\\n- ✅ POST /gas/units/:unitId/entries creates new entry with validation\\n- ✅ Entry validation ensures hours 0-24, valid equipment IDs\\n- ✅ Auto-calculation of qdcAtomizer, qdcLines, qdsCalculated on save\\n- ✅ GET /gas/units/:unitId/entries returns entries for a month\\n- ✅ Query parameter month in YYYY-MM format\\n- ✅ Entries returned with line statuses populated\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-007\n- **What was implemented:** Built unit entry form component for daily gas data entry\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - New form component with all required fields\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/index.ts` - Export file for gas components\n- **Features:**\n  - Date picker with auto-populated today's date\n  - Atomizer scheduled toggle (Yes/No) with hours input\n  - Secondary atomizer fields conditionally shown for units with 2+ atomizers (Botucatu)\n  - Production line toggles dynamically rendered based on unit equipment\n  - Observations text field\n  - Real-time QDS calculation displayed with breakdown (atomizer + lines + total)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Follow existing form patterns from `products/product-form.tsx` and `clients/client-form.tsx`\n    - Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook for form state\n    - UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n    - Use `useMemo` to extract equipment subsets (atomizers, lines) from unit data\n    - Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` prop for reactive calculations\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Avoid complex zod validators with `z.record(z.enum())` - causes type issues with TanStack Form\n    - For nested Record fields, use single `form.Field` with `handleChange` on full object\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, ui editor) - not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n### TanStack Router Route Patterns\n- Protected routes go under `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/{module}/`\n- Each module has `layout.tsx` (with `Outlet`) and `index.tsx`\n- Route path naming: `createFileRoute(\"/_authenticated/{module}/\")` for index routes\n- Feature components live in `apps/web/src/features/{module}/index.tsx`\n- Use Breadcrumb components from `@acme/ui/breadcrumb` with TanStack Router's `Link`\n- Header component pattern: Breadcrumb + `ms-auto` div for right-aligned controls\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-008\n- **What was implemented:** Added form validation and auto-calculation with manual override\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - Added validators, error display, and QDS override\n- **Features:**\n  - Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 - US-008: Add form validation and auto-calculation\n*2026-01-20T03:58:31.890Z (317s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ne `onSubmit` validator\\n- [x] **QDS value updates as user changes inputs** -

Route protected by `_authenticated` layout (authentication check)\n  - Breadcrumb navigation: Home > Gas\n  - Dashboard layout with Header and Main components\n  - Placeholder cards for Consumo Previsto, Consumo Real, Desvio\n  - Units section placeholder\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Protected routes follow `_authenticated/{module}/layout.tsx` + `index.tsx` pattern\n    - Feature components exported from `features/{module}/index.tsx`\n    - Breadcrumb uses `BreadcrumbLink asChild` with TanStack Router's `Link` component\n    - Header pattern: Breadcrumb on left, controls on right with `ms-auto` flex alignment\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash, table, products, clients) are unrelated to new code\n    - Web package uses `typecheck` script (not `check-types`)\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 9 - US-009: Create consolidated dashboard route\n*2026-01-20T04:02:25.283Z (232s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\noute rendering GasDashboard component\\n- `apps/web/src/features/gas/index.tsx` -

`month`: The requested month\n  - `contract`: Active contract with tolerance bands\n  - `units`: List of active units in the organization\n  - `dailySummaries`: Array of daily aggregated data with status and deviations\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `session.activeOrganizationId` from auth context for organization-scoped queries\n    - Filter related models by organization using nested `where: { unit: { organizationId: ... } }`\n    - Use `t.Union([t.Literal(\"a\"), t.Literal(\"b\")])` for enum-like response types in Elysia\n    - Use Record type for grouping data by date key, then convert to array with Object.values()\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Contract lookup needs OR condition for effectiveTo: `OR: [{ effectiveTo: null }, { effectiveTo: { gte: startDate } }]`\n    - When using `for...in` loop on Record, TypeScript narrowing doesn't automatically type the value\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 10 -

US-001\n- **What was implemented:** Added all gas consumption related models to schema.zmodel\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel` - Added enums, models, and relations\n  - `packages/zen-v3/src/zenstack/` - Generated TypeScript files\n- **Models added:**\n  - Enums: EquipmentType, ConsumptionUnit, LineStatusValue, ConsumptionSource\n  - GasUnit, GasEquipment, GasEquipmentConstant\n  - GasDailyEntry, GasLineStatus\n  - GasDailyPlan, GasRealConsumption, GasContract\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - ZenStack uses `pnpm run db:generate` from root to generate TypeScript client\n    - Named relations are required when User has multiple fields referencing the same model\n    - Use `@db.Date` for date-only fields (no time component)\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - The expo app has pre-existing typecheck errors (unrelated to this task)\n    - ZenStack generate runs from root, not from the package directory\n### ZenStack Database Commands\n- `db:generate` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:generate`\n- `db:push` - Run from `packages/zen-v3/` directory: `pnpm run db:push` (uses dotenv for env vars)\n- Root `pnpm run db:push` uses turbo but requires TUI mode (`--ui=tui`)\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-002\n- **What was implemented:** Ran database generation and pushed schema to database\n- **Commands executed:**\n  - `pnpm run db:generate` from `packages/zen-v3/` - Generated TypeScript files successfully\n  -

gas_daily_plans, gas_real_consumption, gas_contracts\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Run `db:generate` and `db:push` from the `packages/zen-v3/` directory directly\n    - The root `db:push` uses turbo which requires TUI mode for interactive tasks\n    - `pnpm with-env` wrapper handles loading .env from root\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Root `pnpm run db:push` fails without TUI mode - use package-level command instead\n    - Typecheck on zen-v3 package passes cleanly after generation\n---\n\n## ✓ Iteration 1 -

`calculateQdcLines`: Sums consumption for lines with ON status only\n  - `calculateQds`: Combines atomizer and lines consumption\n  - `calculateDeviations`: Computes transport and molecule tolerance deviations with status\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Services use plain object with methods pattern (not class-based)\n    - Service files follow `{module}.service.ts` naming convention\n    - Types exported alongside service for external consumption\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - ZenStack enums (like `LineStatusValue`, `EquipmentType`) are generated in `models.ts` but not exported from the zen-v3 package index\n    - Define local type aliases matching enum values to avoid import issues\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 5 - US-005: Implement GasCalculationService\n*2026-01-20T03:42:14.044Z (223s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns 131-143 filter by `status === \\\"on\\\"` and sum consumption\\n- ✅ **calculateQds method combines atomizer and lines consumption** - Lines 154-156 simply adds both values\\n- ✅ **calculateDeviations method computes transport and molecule tolerances** - Lines 174-226 calculate upper/lower limits for both tolerance types\\n- ✅ **Deviation status (within/exceeded) correctly determined** - Transport has 3 states (`within`, `exceeded_upper`, `exceeded_lower`) and molecule has 2 (`within`, `exceeded`)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-006\n- **What was implemented:** Created daily entry API endpoints with validation and auto-calculation\n- **Files changed:**\n  -

Line statuses populated with equipment info on GET\n  - Duplicate entry prevention (unique constraint on unitId+date)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `t.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 24 })` for range validation in Elysia\n    - Use `authDb.$setAuth()` in controller handlers for models with auth defaults\n    - Use `db` (not authDb) for read-only queries or models without auth defaults\n    - Include relations with `include: { relation: { include: { nested: true } } }`\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Array destructuring with `.map(Number)` needs null coalescing for TypeScript\n    - Use `parts[0] ?? 0` instead of direct destructuring `[year, month]`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 6 -

Secondary atomizer fields conditionally shown for units with 2+ atomizers (Botucatu)\n  - Production line toggles dynamically rendered based on unit equipment\n  - Observations text field\n  - Real-time QDS calculation displayed with breakdown (atomizer + lines + total)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Follow existing form patterns from `products/product-form.tsx` and `clients/client-form.tsx`\n    - Use `@tanstack/react-form` with `useForm` hook for form state\n    - UI components imported from `@acme/ui/{component}`\n    - Use `useMemo` to extract equipment subsets (atomizers, lines) from unit data\n    - Use `form.Subscribe` with `selector` prop for reactive calculations\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Avoid complex zod validators with `z.record(z.enum())` - causes type issues with TanStack Form\n    - For nested Record fields, use single `form.Field` with `handleChange` on full object\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, ui editor) - not related to new code\n    - Ultracite/biome not installed despite being referenced in CLAUDE.md\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 7 - US-007: Build unit entry form component\n*2026-01-20T03:53:14.230Z (453s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nime QDS calculation displayed** - Uses `form.Subscribe` with selector to reactively calculate and display atomizer consumption, lines consumption, and total QDS\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Uses `@tanstack/react-form` for form state management\\n- UI components from `@acme/ui` (Button, Card, Input, Label, Switch, Textarea)\\n- Calculation logic mirrors server-side `GasCalculationService` functions\\n- Supports units with single or dual atomizers\\n- Number formatting with Brazilian locale (pt-BR)\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n### TanStack Router Route Patterns\n- Protected routes go under `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/{module}/`\n- Each module has `layout.tsx` (with `Outlet`) and `index.tsx`\n- Route path naming: `createFileRoute(\"/_authenticated/{module}/\")` for index routes\n- Feature components live in `apps/web/src/features/{module}/index.tsx`\n- Use Breadcrumb components from `@acme/ui/breadcrumb` with TanStack Router's `Link`\n- Header component pattern: Breadcrumb + `ms-auto` div for right-aligned controls\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-008\n- **What was implemented:** Added form validation and auto-calculation with manual override\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/components/gas/daily-entry-form.tsx` - Added validators, error display, and QDS override\n- **Features:**\n  - Form validators using Zod (hours 0-24 range, required date)\n  - Visual feedback on validation errors (red border + error messages)\n  - Required field indicators (asterisk on labels)\n  - Manual QDS override toggle with separate input field\n  - Visual differentiation for manual override (amber styling vs primary)\n  - Shows original calculated value when override is active\n  - Submit button disabled when form is invalid (via TanStack Form's canSubmit)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Zod v4 uses `{ message: \"...\" }` instead of `{ required_error: \"...\" }` for date validation\n    - Use `field.state.meta.errors` array to display validation errors\n    - Conditional className with template literals for error styling: `` `w-32 ${field.state.meta.errors.length > 0 ? \"border-destructive\" : \"\"}` ``\n    - Manual override pattern: toggle + conditional input field + display original value\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash components, products, table, etc.) - unrelated to new code\n    - TanStack Form + Zod integration works well with `validators: { onSubmit: z.object({...}) }`\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 8 - US-008: Add form validation and auto-calculation\n*2026-01-20T03:58:31.890Z (317s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ne `onSubmit` validator\\n- [x] **QDS value updates as user changes inputs** - Was already implemented (form.Subscribe with reactive calculation)\\n- [x] **Manual override option available for QDS** - Added toggle switch with manual value input field\\n- [x] **Visual feedback on validation errors** - Red border (`border-destructive`) and error messages displayed\\n- [x] **Submit button disabled when form invalid** - Uses TanStack Form's `!state.canSubmit`\\n\\nAll acceptance criteria have been met.\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-009\n- **What was implemented:** Created consolidated gas dashboard route at /gas\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/gas/layout.tsx` - Layout component with Outlet for child routes\n  - `apps/web/src/routes/_authenticated/gas/index.tsx` - Index route that renders GasDashboard\n  - `apps/web/src/features/gas/index.tsx` - GasDashboard component with breadcrumb and placeholder content\n- **Features:**\n  - Route protected by `_authenticated` layout (authentication check)\n  - Breadcrumb navigation: Home > Gas\n  - Dashboard layout with Header and Main components\n  - Placeholder cards for Consumo Previsto, Consumo Real, Desvio\n  - Units section placeholder\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Protected routes follow `_authenticated/{module}/layout.tsx` + `index.tsx` pattern\n    - Feature components exported from `features/{module}/index.tsx`\n    - Breadcrumb uses `BreadcrumbLink asChild` with TanStack Router's `Link` component\n    - Header pattern: Breadcrumb on left, controls on right with `ms-auto` flex alignment\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in codebase (dash, table, products, clients) are unrelated to new code\n    - Web package uses `typecheck` script (not `check-types`)\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 9 - US-009: Create consolidated dashboard route\n*2026-01-20T04:02:25.283Z (232s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\noute rendering GasDashboard component\\n- `apps/web/src/features/gas/index.tsx` - GasDashboard feature component with breadcrumb navigation\\n\\n**Acceptance Criteria Met:**\\n- Route created at `/gas` (under `_authenticated` for protection)\\n- GasDashboard component renders with placeholder content\\n- Route protected by authentication via `_authenticated` layout's `beforeLoad` check\\n- Breadcrumb navigation in place: Home > Gas\\n\\n**Commit:** `feat: US-009 - Create consolidated dashboard route`\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-010\n- **What was implemented:** Created GET /gas/consolidated endpoint for aggregated data across all units\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts` - Added consolidated endpoint\n- **Endpoint implemented:**\n  - `GET /gas/consolidated?month=YYYY-MM` - Returns consolidated gas data\n- **Features:**\n  - Accepts month query parameter in YYYY-MM format\n  - Returns daily summaries with QDC, QDS, QDP, QDR totals across all units\n  - Calculates status (OK/NOK) for each day based on tolerance bands\n  - Includes transport and molecule tolerance status per day\n  - Data grouped by date with unit breakdown available\n  - Returns active contract info with tolerance percentages\n  - Filters data by organization via session.activeOrganizationId\n- **Response structure:**\n  - `month`: The requested month\n  - `contract`: Active contract with tolerance bands\n  - `units`: List of active units in the organization\n  - `dailySummaries`: Array of daily aggregated data with status and deviations\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `session.activeOrganizationId` from auth context for organization-scoped queries\n    - Filter related models by organization using nested `where: { unit: { organizationId: ... } }`\n    - Use `t.Union([t.Literal(\"a\"), t.Literal(\"b\")])` for enum-like response types in Elysia\n    - Use Record type for grouping data by date key, then convert to array with Object.values()\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Contract lookup needs OR condition for effectiveTo: `OR: [{ effectiveTo: null }, { effectiveTo: { gte: startDate } }]`\n    - When using `for...in` loop on Record, TypeScript narrowing doesn't automatically type the value\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 10 - US-010: Implement consolidated data API endpoint\n*2026-01-20T04:05:20.349Z (174s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ne percentages\\n- `units`: List of active gas units in the organization\\n- `dailySummaries`: Array of daily data with:\\n  - Aggregated totals (qdcTotal, qdsTotal, qdpTotal, qdrTotal)\\n  - Status (ok/nok)\\n  - Transport status (within/exceeded_upper/exceeded_lower)\\n  - Molecule status (within/exceeded)\\n  - Deviation calculations\\n  - Per-unit breakdown\\n\\n**File changed:** `apps/server/src/modules/gas/gas.controller.ts`\\n\\n**Commit:** `feat: US-010 - Implement consolidated data API endpoint`\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-011\n- **What was implemented:** Built summary cards showing QDC, QDS, QDP, QDR values with visual styling\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/features/gas/index.tsx` - Updated GasDashboard with 4 summary cards\n  - `apps/web/src/routeTree.gen.ts` - Regenerated route tree (fixed missing gas routes)\n- **Features:**\n  - QDC card shows contracted daily quantity (134,800 m³) with blue styling\n  - QDS card shows calculated/forecasted consumption with amber styling\n  - QDP card shows programmed quantity with purple styling\n  - QDR card shows real consumption from meters with green styling\n  - Cards styled with left border colors and matching icons\n  - Values formatted with Brazilian locale (pt-BR) thousand separators and m³ unit\n  - Fetches data from `/gas/consolidated` API endpoint using useQuery\n  - Displays list of units with clickable cards\n  - Loading states and error handling included\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `api.{module}.{endpoint}.get({ query: {...} })` pattern for Elysia Treaty API calls\n    - Use `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching in components\n    - Card styling with `border-l-4 border-l-{color}-500` for colored left borders\n    - Format numbers with `value.toLocaleString(\"pt-BR\")` for Brazilian locale\n    - Use `useMemo` for calculating derived values from API response\n    - TanStack Router regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` when dev server runs\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Elysia Treaty error types have complex union types - use type casting `as { error?: string }` for error handling\n    - If routes are missing from routeTree.gen.ts, run the dev server to trigger regeneration\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in dash, table, products components are unrelated to new code\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 11 - US-011: Build summary cards with Base UI\n*2026-01-20T04:10:19.548Z (298s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ntyling\\n- ✅ Cards styled with appropriate colors (`border-l-4 border-l-{color}-500`) and icons\\n- ✅ Values formatted with thousand separators (Brazilian locale pt-BR) and m³ units\\n\\n### Features Added\\n- Fetches data from `/gas/consolidated` API endpoint using `useQuery`\\n- Displays list of units with clickable cards\\n- Loading states and error handling included\\n- Uses lucide-react icons: FileText, Calculator, Gauge, Activity\\n\\n### Commit\\n`feat: US-011 - Build summary cards with Base UI`\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-20 - US-012\n- **What was implemented:** Added tolerance band visualization with green/yellow/red status indicators\n- **Files changed:**\n  - `apps/web/src/features/gas/index.tsx` - Added tolerance indicator cards with tooltips\n- **Features:**\n  - Transport tolerance card showing ±20%/+10% range with status indicator\n  - Molecule tolerance card showing ±5% range with status indicator\n  - Green indicator when within tolerance bands\n  - Yellow indicator when approaching limits (within 5% of boundary)\n  - Red indicator when tolerance exceeded\n  - Tooltips on hover showing exact values (deviation, limits, status)\n  - Dynamic TrendingUp/TrendingDown icons based on deviation direction\n  - Dark mode support with appropriate color variants\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered:\n    - Use `@acme/ui/tooltip` with `Tooltip`, `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent` components\n    - TooltipTrigger requires `asChild` prop when wrapping Card components\n    - Use `cursor-help` class to indicate hoverable tooltip elements\n    - Yellow \"approaching limits\" threshold calculated as 5% of the tolerance band\n    - Use `useMemo` to derive tolerance summary from API response\n  - Gotchas encountered:\n    - Pre-existing typecheck errors in dash, table, products, editor components are unrelated to new code\n    - Tolerance color logic requires checking both status and proximity to limits for yellow state\n---\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":76,"oldLines":6,"newStart":76,"newLines":19,"lines":[" - Format Brazilian numbers: `value.toLocaleString(\"pt-BR\")`"," -
