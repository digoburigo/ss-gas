# Project Rules

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following structure using Turborepo:

- **`apps/web/`** - Frontend application (React with TanStack Router)

- **`apps/server/`** - Backend server (Elysia)

- **`packages/api/`** - Shared API logic and types with tRPC
- **`packages/auth/`** - Authentication logic and utilities with better-auth
- **`packages/zen-v3/`** - Database schema and utilities with ZenStack v3

- **`apps/expo/`** - React Native mobile app (with NativeWind)

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `pnpm run dev:spa` - Start only the server and web app

## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the server workspace:

- `pnpm run db:push` - Push schema changes to database (ZenStack v3 push)
- `pnpm run db:studio` - Open database studio (drizzle-kit studio)
- `pnpm run db:generate` - Generate ZenStack v3 files
- `pnpm run db:migrate` - Run database migrations (ZenStack v3 prisma like migrations)

Database schema files are located in `packages/zen-v3/schema.zmodel`

## API Structure

- Controllers for Elysia endpoints are in `apps/server/src/modules/`
- Client-side Elysia Treaty utils are in `apps/web/src/clients/api-client.ts`
- Client-side ZenStack v3 client can be imported from `@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/react` and `@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/server` and be used in the components like this:

```ts
import { schema } from "@acme/zen-v3/zenstack/schema";
import { useClientQueries } from "@zenstackhq/tanstack-query/react";

export function Model() {
const client = useClientQueries(schema);
const { data, error } = client.model.useFindMany();

if (error) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
}
return <div>Model: {data.map((model) => model.prop)}</div>;
}
```

## Authentication

Authentication is enabled in this project:

- Server auth logic is in `apps/server/src/plugins/better-auth.ts`
- Web app auth client is in `apps/web/src/clients/auth-client.ts`
- Native app auth client is in `apps/native/src/utils/auth.ts`

## Key Points

- This is a Turborepo monorepo using pnpm workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `pnpm run command-name`
- Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
